    "    * Transforms real-valued time series into a sequence of discrete \"words\".\n",
    "    * Classification is based on the distribution of the extracted symbolic words.\n",
    "    * A series in a window `w` is transformed into a \"word\" of length `l` - word consists of `Î±` possible letters.\n",
